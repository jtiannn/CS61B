The test-ataxx.py script performs integration tests, feeding inputs to
one or two instances of the ataxx program and checking that required
outputs meet specifications.  It takes a list of test-specification
files and interprets their contents.  These specification files have the
following formats:

* All blank lines and lines whose first non-blank character is "#" are
  ignored.  These may be used to document tests.  In the rest of this
  discussion, we assume all such lines have been removed.

* A line of 10 or more dashes separates the file into two section corresponding
  to two different instances of ataxx that are run simultaneously.  In the
  absence of such a line, only one instance of the program is tested.

* Each section begins with a line containing a shell command, which
  is executed to start one instance of the ataxx program. In
  what follows, when we say "our program", we mean "the program being run
  in this section," while "the other program" means "the program being run
  in the other section."

* A line of the form
     @time T
  in a section sets a time limit of T seconds per move.  The test case fails
  if the limit is exceeded for any move or expected output.
  By default, it is 10 seconds.

* A line of the form
     @total-time T
  in either section sets a time limit of T seconds on the entire test.  There
  should only be one.  By default it is 60 seconds.

* A line of the form
     @<TEXT
  specifies that the next line of filtered output from the program in this
  section (see below) must exactly match TEXT, ignoring trailing blanks and
  treating multiple blanks as one.

* A line of the form
     @?PATTERN
  specifies that the next line of filtered output from the program in this
  section (see below) must match PATTERN, a Python (raw) pattern.  This is
  is essentially the same as for Java pattern strings, except that one does
  not double backslash characters.

* The line
     @red...ENDPATN
  matches a sequence of lines of the form "Red moves ..." or "Red passes" 
  followed by "Blue moves ..." or "Blue passes", etc., from the program for 
  this section, ending with a "... wins." or "Draw" message.  ENDPATN is
  an optional Python pattern.  If present, it must match the "wins" or
  "Draw" line (as for @?).

* The line
     @blue...ENDPATN
  is similar, except that the first move is from Blue.

* The line
     @send red...ENDPATN

  behaves like @red...ENDPATN, except that the red moves are sent to
  the program in the other section, which sends back blue moves in
  response.  The programs also send the final "...wins." or "Draw."
  messages to each other, which must match.

* The line
     @send blue...ENDPATN
  is as for '@send red...', but expects a blue move from our AI.

* The line
     @recv red...ENDPATN
  is like @send red...ENDPATN, except that the first move (for red)
  comes from the other program.

* The line
     @recv blue...ENDPATN
  is as for '@recv red...ENDPATN', but expects a blue move from the other
  program first.

* All other lines not starting with "@" are fed to our program verbatim.
  
The output from the program in a section is *filtered* before being compared
to the @< and @? lines.  Specifically:

   * All prefixes of lines that end in ":" are removed, along with 
     any whitespace after the colon.

   * All lines containing any of the words "wins", "passes", "draw", or
     "moves" (ignoring upper/lower case) are kept.

   * All lines between two "===" delimiters are retained, as are
     the delimiters themselves.

   * All other lines, and all lines sent to the standard error stream
     (System.err in Java) are ignored.
